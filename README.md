# hello-world
hi all, what's up!
this is Yash. i just learnt java with good hands on practice in data structures and algorithm. i am a little bit confused what to do next.i want a transition of my coding skills from java to kotlin, and hence enter in the world of android app development. 
Wish me best of luck!
thanks
